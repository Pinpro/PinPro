# Browser Extensions

Lapo Luchini has been kind enough to create extensions for both Chrome and
Firefox. You can find his repo for these extensions at:

- [https://github.com/lapo-luchini/browser-pinry](https://github.com/lapo-luchini/browser-pinry)

If you'd like to install either extension they are available at:

- [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jmhdcnmfkglikfjafdmdikoonedgijpa/](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jmhdcnmfkglikfjafdmdikoonedgijpa/)
- [https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/add-to-pinry/](https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/add-to-pinry/)
